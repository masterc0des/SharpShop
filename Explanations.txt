MVC Architecture:

Model:
Represents the shape of the Data. A class in C# is used to describe the model.
The class in C# represents the table in the Database.

View:
Represents the user interface. The view determines how the display and data is
displayed.

Controller:
Handles the user request and acts as an interface between Model and View to
process all the business logic and it manipulates data using the model and 
interacts with the view to render the proper output.

1. Client request to Controller
2. Controller posts data from the model
3. Model processes the data
4. Model returns the processed data to the controller
5. Controller posts data to the view 
6. The view creates the proper view for the client
7. The view returns the presentation to the controller
8. The Controller returns the response to the client


Routing in MVC:

The URL pattern for routing is considered after the domain name.
https://localhost:55555/Category/Index/3
https://localhost:55555/{controller}/{action}/{id}

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| URL											Controller		Action		Id		|
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| https://localhost:55555/Category/Index		Category		Index		Null	|
| https://localhost:55555/Category				Category		Index		Null	|
| https://localhost:55555/Category/Edit/3		Category		Edit		3		|
| https://localhost:55555/Producr/Details/3		Product			Details		3		|
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Id is an optional route, controller and action are not optional.
If they are not definded, they will be automatically assigned to a default value.

The "shared" folder is used for partial views (header and footer).

To create a migration (... a class with methods that create the table):
add-migration AddUsersToDatabase

To push the migration to database
update-database
